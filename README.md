In Python, me and three of my classmates created a Task Management System with two excel files. Each user is able to log-in to their own account, and create a task that will be held in an excel file. This excel file keeps track of the name of the task, a breif description, the date, the starting time and the length of the task. Every user is able to create, remove, edit and search through only their added tasks. They will also be able to use an interactive calendar to check for their tasks for a given day. Each user is kept track of through an excel file with an Admin account built into it. This admin account is allowed to create and edit other users. The admin user can change their own username and password, as well as complete the same tasks as a regular user. There are different files representing each phase of the project build, as well as a devlopment log of the program. Due to the use of excel files and png files, the program only works if the excel file is specified to the users computer, and the user has a file of the pdfs.
